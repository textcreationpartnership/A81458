            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WEE your Majeſties moſt dutifull and obedient Subjects, before we were encouraged by the influence of your Majeſties preſence, knew not what to doe, being amazed with feares and jealouſies rumored and ſpread abroad; whereby divers of your Majeſties good Subjects were diſtracted; and the more, becauſe we neither knew nor could imagine any cauſe or feare of jealouſie: SIR, I cannot more properly compare our caſe then to a man in perfect health, yet doth fancie himſelfe ſicke of a Conſumption; who (if his fortune be to light of a skilfull and honeſt Phyſitian) is in no danger; but, if upon an Empricke, it is like his body ſhall be brought into that condition, which before he did but fancy himſelfe to be in. I am doubtfull, if thoſe perſons who have bin the cauſe of raiſing and fomenting theſe feares and jealouſies might chuſe their owne Phyſitian, and apply their owne medicine, it would hazard the ruine of the Common-wealth, by aboliſhing the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and fundamentall Lawes therof. But the Subjects of this Nation (God be thanked) are in a better caſe: It is not in the power of thoſe evill ſpirits, either to make choice of a Phyſitian, or to apply the Medicine; your ſacred Majeſty being our great Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and without your Majeſties conſent and command no medicine can be applied. And to the unſpeakable joy and comfort of all your Majeſties faithfull Subjects it is ſufficiently ſignified to the world, by your Majeſties moſt Kingly Declarations, expreſſing your reſolution to maintaine and governe by the knowne Lawes of this Realme; to defend the true Proteſtant Religion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Law: By which meanes your loyall Subjects ſhall be preſerved and protected from Arbitrary Government. Let the moſt evill affected perſon then deny (if he can) but that we have from our King what is to be wiſhed, and that without asking or petitioning for. There is onely one Queſtion to be asked, and a ſhort Anſwer thereunto, What is now to be done? To which every ingenious ſoule muſt acknowledge the want is on our parts; we owe all we have to be diſpoſed of by your Majeſty for the maintenance and preſervation of your juſt rights and prerogative, which cannot be maintained, but thereby the priviledges of your Subjects will be likewiſe defended; the ſame Law defending both; and under which Law the people of this Nation have bin moſt happily governed under your Majeſty and your moſt noble Progenitours many hundred yeeres. For the continuance of which Government, for my owne particular (proſtrating my ſelfe at your Majeſties feet) I humbly offer and render unto your Majeſty my ſelfe, eſtate and fortune. And SIR, I have warrant from the Major of this Citie and the whole body of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, to beſeech your Majeſty to accept of the like offer from them. So with this ſhort ejaculation I ſhall conclude; beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to bleſſe and preſerve your ſacred perſon, and this our moſt noble and hopeful Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> with all your royall iſſue; and that this Nation and people, and all your Dominions may be governed by your Majeſty and your poſterity to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Whereas both the Houſes of Parliament have Voted a neceſſity of putting the Kingdome into a poſture of Warre, for the ſuppreſſing of any Inſurrection within, or Forces from without; and have (by their example and acceptance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offers to maintaine Horſe and Foot armed for that purpoſe) given us, whoſe names are here underwritten, occaſion (conſidering the preſent diſtractions amongſt us) to undertake to maintaine and have in readineſſe ſuch number of Horſe furniſhed fit for warre, as we doe here ſubſcribe to, for the maintenance and defence of his Majeſties juſt Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the Proteſtant Religion, as it is now eſtabliſhed; the Lawes of the Realme, the juſt priviledges of Parliament, and the publique Peace, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever: And the ſaid Horſe to be diſpoſed of within the County for three moneths after the 20. of this inſtant <hi>July;</hi> at ſuch time, and in ſuch way as his Majeſty ſhall by his Commiſſion direct.</p>
